 NC      =      Number of layers in the velocity model (not used !!!)
 NFREQ   =      Number of frequencies to compute
 TL      =   	Length of the time window to compute (sec)
 AW      =		Something to do with average period of waves in seconds (not sure!!!)
 NR      =      Number of receivers (in stations.dat file)
 NS      =      Number of sources (keep 1)
 XL      =      Maximal distance (km) (should be >> to source-receiver distance)
 IKMAX   =      Maximal number of iterations
 UCONV   =		(not idea!!!)
 FREF    =   	Refeerence frequency (Hz)
 
 1/TL    =  delta frequency (Hz)
 1/TL * (NFREQ-1) = max frequency (Hz)
 dt = TL/(2^mm) mm set in .for code
